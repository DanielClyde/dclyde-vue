# dclyde-vue

This is a simple vue component library written in Vue 3 with Typescript, Tailwindcss and built with Vite.

## Recommended Setup

In your Vue app's `main.ts` file, import the `style.css` like so: `import '../node_modules/dclyde-vue/dist/style.css';`. This will bring in the default Tailwindcss styles for each of the components.

To use a component, just import it into the `.vue` file that you wish to use it in like `import { Input } from 'dclyde-vue';`.
